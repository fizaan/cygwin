Faiz notes:

Your chance of winning the lottery is directly proportioanl to the #
of tickets you hold/own

"Tickets Represent Your Share" Or in other words represent your chances 
of winning the lottery, and winning the lottery means your PROCESS gets 
to run

My question: Do tickets have "weights"? No, but they do have
	- currency
	
Processes also have the ability to:
	- transfer tickets between themselves
	- inflate their own tickets to give themselves higher chances 
	of winning lottery (CPU)
